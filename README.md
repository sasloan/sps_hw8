CIS 2110
Homework Assignment #8

Learning Objectives: 
 To demonstrate the student's ability to process and write functions in Python 
Assignment:
 Don’t start this assignment until you have reach chapters 1-5 of “Python for Everyone” 
AND watched the following youtube videos: 
 All outputs in these programs should be formatted to 2 decimal places, unless otherwise 
specified.  
 For this homework, you will write 5 programs.  For each program, you will write one or 
more functions.
 Submit ONE file that contains all of your programs and runs program 1, then program 2, 
then program 3, etc., when I execute the file.  
Program 1
Write a function called SumOfThree that accepts 3 floating point numbers as parameters.  
The function should return the sum of the numbers.
Write a function called AvgOfThree that accepts 3 floating point numbers as parameters.  
The function should return the average of the numbers.  
Write a function called BigOfThree that accepts 3 floating point numbers as parameters.  
The function should return the LARGEST of the 3 numbers.  
Write a program that gets 3 integers from the user and then uses the functions SumOfThree, 
AvgOfThree, and BigOfThree to find the sum, average, and largest of the 3 numbers.  The 
results should be printed to the user’s screen.  The user interface should be easy to use and 
formatted with care.
 Program 2
Write a function called FindArea that takes in 2 parameters- the height and width of a rectangle.  
The function should return the area of the rectangle. Hint:   area = width * height
Write a python program that asks the user for a height and width, uses FindArea to find the area 
of the rectangle, and outputs the area of the rectangle to the user.
Program 3
It is still very common to create phone numbers that include words so that they are easy to 
remember.  For example, 1-800-flowers or 1-800-taxiusa    
Write a function (name is up to you!) that accepts the last 7 characters of a 1-800 number and 
turns them into numbers, based on the letters and numbers assigned on the dial of a phone.  If the 
character is a number- then use that number.  Otherwise, translate the letter into a number.  The 
function should return the last 7 characters of the 1800 number entered by the user.  
Now- write a Python program that asks the user to enter a 1-800 number, and then uses your 
function to translate the the last 7 numbers of the number to numbers. 
Your program should output the 1-800 number as a series of numbers.  (you may format the 
numbers if you like!)
For example:
Please enter a 1-800 number you would like to translate.  Do not include 
hyphens:    1800BIGFISH 
The number you want to call is:   18002443474
Guidelines:
 For each program, create a header that prints when you run the rile.  The header should 
state your name, the assignment number, the program number, and a brief description of 
what the program does. 
 ALL of your code must always be within this file- you will lose points if you attempt to 
import libraries or code that is external to the file (I’m happy if you can do this, but for 
now let’s keep it simple, k?)
 Give priority to writing CODE THAT WORKS.  If you can’t get part of the code to run, 
comment out that part and tell me (in the comment) what you were trying to do so I can 
give you partial credit.  I will take off points for code that doesn’t run- I shouldn’t have to 
debug your code just to get it to run.      
 I suggest you use comments liberally
